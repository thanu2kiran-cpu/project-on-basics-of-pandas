# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis
# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior using Python. The goal is to clean raw e-commerce data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate meaningful insights, and prepare a final clean dataset for business decision-making.

The analysis helps understand customer trends, purchasing patterns, and revenue distribution across different demographics.

# Objectives

Understand customer purchasing behavior

Clean and preprocess raw data

Perform feature engineering

Generate business insights using analysis and visualizations

Prepare a final, analysis-ready dataset

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level purchase information with the following features:

Column Name	Description
Customer ID	Unique customer identifier
Age	Age of the customer
Gender	Gender of the customer
Item Purchased	Product purchased
Category	Product category
Purchase Amount (USD)	Purchase value
Location	Customer location
Color	Product color

Review Rating	Customer rating
Subscription Status	Subscription details
Shipping Type	Shipping mode
Discount Applied	Discount applied or not
Promo Code Used	Promo code usage

# Project Workflow
# 1 Data Understanding & Inspection

Checked data types and structure

Identified missing values and inconsistencies

# 2️ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Corrected data formats

Removed inconsistencies

# 3️ Feature Engineering

Created new features such as:

Signup Month

Signup Week

Purchase Status (Yes / No)

# 4️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Age group vs purchase amount

Gender-wise purchase count

Category-wise revenue

Monthly revenue trends

Discount and promo code impact

# 5️ Business Insights

Customers who signed up but never purchased

Cities with highest revenue

Age group with highest average purchase

Percentage of customers purchasing above a threshold

# 6️ Final Dataset

No missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Clean and analysis-ready data

# Visualizations

Bar charts

Line plots

Count plots

Box plots

Heatmaps

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to clearly represent trends and patterns.

# Key Insights

Certain age groups contribute higher average purchase amounts

Discount and promo codes influence customer buying behavior

Subscription customers show higher repeat purchases

Revenue varies significantly across locations and seasons
